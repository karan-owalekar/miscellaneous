## Wisdom of the Crowd Simulation

The "Wisdom of the Crowd" simulation in this repository follows the principle of a random forest approach. In this simulation, we set the probability of one person giving the correct answer. Then, we collect predictions from each individual and utilize them to generate a collective prediction from the crowd. By harnessing the collective intelligence of diverse individuals, this simulation explores how aggregating opinions can often lead to more accurate predictions than individual judgments alone.
