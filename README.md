## Wisdom of the Crowd Simulation

The "Wisdom of the Crowd" simulation in this repository follows the principle of a random forest approach. In this simulation, we set the probability of one person giving the correct answer. Then, we collect predictions from each individual and utilize them to generate a collective prediction from the crowd. By harnessing the collective intelligence of diverse individuals, this simulation explores how aggregating opinions can often lead to more accurate predictions than individual judgments alone.

> Explaination: Even if an individual's probability of correct prediction is, for example, 0.6, out of 100 individuals, we can expect approximately 60 correct predictions on average. By aggregating these predictions, the crowd's collective wisdom can often lead to more accurate outcomes. Since we only need a simple majority (51 of 100) for the crowd's prediction to be considered.
